# App description
Fake Tweet is small demo application with twitter funtionality made in Symfony 4. Purpose of this app is to help me to go through the process of deploying app, learn some basic continius intagration things, and also to improve my Symfony4 skills. So when I push changes to master branch on Github, test will be run, and if they pass, changes will be automatically deployd by CircleCi automated server. Because this is demo app for learning, I made one small test which will always pass, so on every push on master branch, changes will be deployed. Source code is on this link. App is still in progress.
